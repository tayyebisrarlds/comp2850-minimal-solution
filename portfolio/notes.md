# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-18 11:41]
**Context**: [prefers dark mode, uses trackpad, can type normally, no underlying health conditions]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~20 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use Reminders on my phone regularly, upwards of 3x a week. I use notes to organise my which modules I study each day, e.g. at the beginning of the week I'll check everything I need to do for the week and assign some tasks each day, but it's nothing complex. I find reminders easy to use, and it's nice to be able to be reminded at a specific time. I don't find tags useful.

**Observations**:
- Prefers simple, lightweight task managers
- Uses reminders frequently for the simple scheduling
- Prefers time-based remnders rather than tags. Finds them unnecessary
- Lightweight workflow

**Themes**: `lightweight_workflow`, `time_based`, `tag_irrelevance`

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "It doesn't notify me as forcefully as I'd like, often just with a little 'ding' sound effect. I don't like the 'tap-to-delete' functionality, I prefer a simpler, more obvious one with clear confirmation, without accidentally removing something. i.e. 'Are you sure you want to delete this?'"

**Observations**:
- Low confirmation feedback, prefers stronger notifications
- Low trust in interface, dislikes tap-to-delete
- Explicitly desires clear confirmation before deletion

**Themes**: `notifications`, `confirmation`, `trust`

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Not that I can remember, but if my phone dies I'll miss any important reminders for that day until I recharge it. I always set reminders for a specific time so ordering isn't an issue."

**Observations**:
- Hasn't lost tasks, but is prone to battery dying, temporarily removing access
- Relies on precise reminder times
- Risk is in technology dependence rather than organisational difficulty

**Themes* `device_dependency`, `time_based`, `notifications`

### Q4: What would you do if your trackpad broke?
**Response**: "I'd try get it repaired at a repair shop, or buy a mouse if not possible. During that time, I would probably log onto another computer in the meantime. I find using just the keyboard is infeasible."

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only experience = friction
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware)
- Exclusion from features, loss of usability

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "I don't experience any issues with bright lights. I sometimes have to zoom in on the browser when using a second monitor so the proportion matches my laptop's."

**Observations**:
- No major issues with bright light
- Sometimes has to zoom in when using second monitor
- Zooming affects layout, focus on responsiveness

**Themes**: `multi_monitor`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A progress report at the start of the day, sent to my phone or email. Also a message like an hour before, but an email an hour before might not be as useful because I don't check my email as often."

**Observations**:
- Prefers phone notification versus email, due to less checking frequency
- Daily progress report is desired
- Interested in pre-event reminders (e.g. 1 hour in advance)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `notifications`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Weak notfications → easy to miss reminders
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty, fear of accidental removal
3. Poor keyboard navigation → temporary exclusion
4. Zoom-related layout issues → scaling issues on multi-screen setups

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I receive a reminder, I want it to be more noticable, so I don't miss it even in busy moments."
- "When I delete a task, I want a confirmation prompt so I don't accidentally remove something important."
- "When I switch screens or zoom in, I want responsiveness so it remains easy to view and navigate."
