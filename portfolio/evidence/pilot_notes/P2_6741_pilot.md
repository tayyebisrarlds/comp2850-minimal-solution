# Notes

## T1
- Simple task, basic testing.
- Make it known to the user that the title is >= 3 characters.
- Add a description for that section.
- Moderately confident in using the keyboard navigation.

## T2
- Easy to remove task
- Pop-up window is reassuring
- Would it work with a screen reader (from a dev perspective)?
- Recycle bin to restore deleted tasks
- Delete should signal danger, with colour red

## T3
- Different colour for edit/save buttons, symbols maybe
- Intuitive to edit a task
- Text is good-sized

## T4
- Easy to use
- Looks nice
- Totally fine as-is

## T5
- Works the same
- Refresh is a little annoying
