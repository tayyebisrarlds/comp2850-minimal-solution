# Notes

## T1
- Task was easy and intuitive
- Using Tab for navigation is standard and simple
- Somewhat comfortable using keyboard navigation, but prefers mouse
- Alert wasn't immediately visible

## T2
- Very easy, easier than the first, because mouse is available for navigation
- Delete could be red to signal danger.
- Prompt is fine

## T3
- Little harder due to more options - need to be careful about pressing the right button
- Cancel is smaller than Save which is nice so don't accidentally cancel.

## T4
- Fast when filtering, it's not immediately obvious if being filtered or not when viewed from above
- Filter button seems redundant because the bar itself handles the filtering

## T5
- Easy to use
- No alert is given on page refresh
- Didn't notice the refreshes
