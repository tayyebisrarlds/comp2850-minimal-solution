## 1. Protocol & Tasks

### Link to Needs-Finding (LO2)

## **Week 6 Job Story #1**: Keyboard Navigation

**Situation**: When I stop being able to use my trackpad/mouse
**Motivation**: I want to be able to navigate the task manager using alternative methods
**Outcome**: So I can continue managing tasks without being limited by hardware issues
**Underlying need**: Because depending solely on one input method creates an accessibility gap and interrupts task completion
**WCAG**: 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)

**How Task 1 tests this**: The participant tests a relevant function with no mouse, ensuring usability.

## **Week 6 Job Story #2**: Confirmation visible

**Situation**: When I submit a form (add/edit/delete task)
**Motivation**: I want immediate, explicit confirmation that the action succeeded
**Outcome**: So I can trust the interface without refreshing to verify
**Underlying need**: Because uncertainty about save status causes anxiety and inefficient workarounds
**WCAG**: 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)

**How Task 2 tests this**: The participant performs a task requiring a confirmation message, and verifies the job story's concern is addressed.

## **Week 6 Job Story #3**: Updating Task Details

**Situation**: When I realise I need to change a detail about a task (e.g., due date, priority, description)
**Motivation**: I want to be able to quickly edit the task without starting from scratch
**Outcome**: So I don't waste time remaking and deleting tasks and losing momentum
**Underlying need**: Because maintaining up-to-date task information is essential for effective time management.
**WCAG**: WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)

**How Task 3 tests this**: Participant edits a given task with a more relevant name, demonstrating the working edit function.

## **Week 6 Job Story #4**: Filtering Tasks

**Situation**: When I look through my task list
**Motivation**: I want to be able to separate my tasks using a search
**Outcome**: So it remains easy to view and navigate certain tasks when there is a lot
**Underlying need**: Because searching through a lot of tasks is cumbersome
**WCAG**: 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA)

**How Task 4 tests this**: The participant tests the filter functionality and uses it to successfully delete a task.

## Week 6 Story S5: Reliable Access On Low Battery
**Situation**: When I lose charge on my phone, therefore losing access to timed reminders
**Motivation**: I want backup visibility (e.g. desktop alerts or synced reminders)
**Outcome**: So I don't miss important tasks due to one device failing
**Underlying need**: Because relying solely on one device increases the vulnerability of missed deadlines
**WCAG**: 2.4.5 Multiple Ways (AA)

**Task was not assigned for this story**

## Week 6 Story S6: No JavaScript is No Problem
**Situation**: When I cannot use JavaScript on my browser
**Motivation**: I want to still be able to use my applications, like my todo list.
**Outcome**: So I don't miss important deadlines just because of a software or hardware limitation
**Underlying need**: Because being able to use apps in different modes of accessibility is crucial for a well-designed application.

**How Task 5 tests this**: The participant tests the navigation and functionality of the app when JavaScript is disabled.

- **Action**: Please use the keyboard only to navigate to the 'Add Task' textbox, enter a task, then save it.
- **Success**: User has successfully created a new task
- **Target time**: <10 seconds
- **Linked to**: Week 6 S1

#### Task 2 (T2): Confirmation Visible

- **Scenario**: You have a list of tasks that you’ve been managing, and you’re ready to clean up your task list by removing a completed or irrelevant task
- **Action**: Please navigate to 'delete task', and delete a task of your choice. Look for and acknowledge the notification.
- **Success**: Notification of task successfully appears, and is acknowledged by the user.
- **Target time**: <8 seconds
- **Linked to**: Week 6 S2

#### Task 3 (T3): Updating Task Details

- **Scenario**: You've just completed the first section of a multi-step task, and it seems wrong to create a new task for the next part.
- **Action**: Please edit a task from the list, giving it the name '[Name of the task] Part 2', and then save it.
- **Success**: The task is saved in the list with the correct name, and there is an alert confirmation at the top.
- **Target time**: <10 seconds
- **Linked to**: Week 6 S3

#### Task 4 (T4): Filtering Tasks

- **Scenario**: You've not got a lot of time to waste, and you need to find a certain task very quickly. There are 7 tasks already present.
- **Action**: Please use the filter text box to filter the tasks for 'update'. Delete the only task that appears.
- **Success**: The task 'Software update' is successfully deleted.
- **Target time**: <14 seconds
- **Linked to**: Week 6 S4

#### Task 5 (T5): No JavaScript is No Problem

- **Scenario**: Your browser's JavaScript functionality has stopped working - lots of websites you've tried no longer load correctly. You need to access your tasks to add something you have due later.
- **Action**: Please navigate to the tasks list, and add a task named 'Check add noJS'. Save it, then navigate back to it, and delete the task named 'Delete noJs'.
- **Success**: The task 'Check add noJS' is successfully added, and 'Delete noJS' has been deleted. 
- **Target time**: <13 seconds
- **Linked to**: Week 6 S6

### Screenshots

| Filename | What it shows | Context/Link to finding |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| before-sr-error.png | Error message without role="alert" | Finding #1 - SR errors not announced |
| after-sr-error.png | Error message WITH role="alert" added | Fix #1 verification |
| regression-axe-report.png | axe DevTools showing 0 violations | Verification Part A |
| [your-screenshot-3.png] | [Description] | [Which finding/fix this supports] |

**PII check**:
- [ ] All screenshots cropped to show only relevant UI
- [ ] Browser bookmarks/tabs not visible
- [ ] Participant names/emails blurred or not visible

## Evidence Chain Example (Full Trace)

**Instructions**: Pick ONE finding and show complete evidence trail from data → fix → verification.

**Finding selected**: [e.g., "Finding #1 - SR errors not announced"]

**Evidence trail**:
1. **Data**: metrics.csv lines 47-49 show P2 (SR user) triggered validation_error 3 times
2. **Observation**: P2 pilot notes timestamp 14:23 - Quote: "I don't know if it worked, didn't hear anything"
3. **Screenshot**: before-sr-error.png shows error message has no role="alert" or aria-live
4. **WCAG**: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A) violation - errors not programmatically announced
5. **Prioritisation**: findings-table.csv row 1 - Priority score 7 (Impact 5 + Inclusion 5 - Effort 3)
6. **Fix**: implementation-diffs.md Fix #1 - Added role="alert" + aria-live="assertive" to error span
7. **Verification**: verification.csv Part A row F2 - 3.3.1 now PASS (tested with NVDA)
8. **Before/after**: verification.csv Part B - SR error detection improved from 0% to 100%
9. **Re-pilot**: P5 (SR user) pilot notes - "Heard error announcement immediately, corrected and succeeded"

**Complete chain**: Data → Observation → Interpretation → Fix → Verification ✅
