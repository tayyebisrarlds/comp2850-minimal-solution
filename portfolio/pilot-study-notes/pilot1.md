# Notes

## T1
- Time was stressful (pressure)
- Works fine
- Tab is simple and easy to use
- Moderately confident using keyboard navigation, doesn't use it often

## T2
- Simple to delete a task
- Having to confirm each time is annoying
- Mouse is slow

## T3
- Editing task button is rather big and imposing
- Double-click to edit would be nice
- Name is very small compared to buttons
- Edit & Delete look similar (colourwise), could be red for delete.

## T4
- Apply filter button is pointless, as the search is dynamic
- Filtering section looks nice/polished (UI).
- Feels like a search bar - no ability to search by time created/category.

## T5
- No confirmation on deletion, could add
- Otherwise no noticeable difference, refresh is so fast and therefore can't see it.
- Quick
